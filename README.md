# GameOfLife-Simulator


# The Program
The Game of Life Simulator is a Java program which simulates Conway's Game of Life, which is a cellular automaton developed John Conway in around 1970. The program is used to simulate evolution of real life based on certain rules.

# Rules 
The rules of the Game of Life are simple. Cells are born or set 'alive' by users at the start but they cannot interract with them once the cycle starts. The cells that start out alive will either continue to survive or die based on these rules:
1. Any cell with two or three neighboring cells survives
2. Dead cells can come to life if they have 3 neighbors

This was my first experience learning Java GUI, so a lot of my process was spent looking at tutorials and how other people created GUI's for cellular automaton simulators as well. I got a good introduction to things like listeners and JFrame functions while learning this.
